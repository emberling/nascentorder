Nascent Order for Final Fantasy VI
a supplemental randomizer by emberling
version 0.0.2c   (alpha -- expect brokenness)

The main goal of this project is to build on top of FF6 Beyond Chaos to create
the randomized experience that most appeals to me. I'm fascinated by randomly
generated art pieces and story projects, things like @MagicRealismBot and
botnik.org. I'm not looking to challenge myself (gameplay wise) or to spark
hilarious moments on twitch dot teevee so much as I'm looking to create
fresh experiences that would be believable as alternate-universe versions
of FF6.

NaO is designed specifically for use with a ROM already run through Beyond
Chaos, but it is also designed to be highly flexible and to work with any
hacked ROM you give it! Some may require some reconfiguration, though, and
there are many permutations I haven't yet coded in. But in general, while
it's not the main intent of this program, it CAN be used as a tool to
insert and repack music for your non-random hack, for instance.

My rewrites and mods, and the modules contained herein, are
generally built around the idea of *curated* randomness. Fire can be
red, or yellow, or orange, or even blue, but not green. Grandpa can be
a knight or a ninja or a mime, but not a child.

Or you can turn that off, if you'd rather. I'm not picky about what YOU do.

Many of the Beyond Chaos systems are based around taking existing FF6 systems
-- palettes, spells, items, enemy AI -- in new, surprising, and incongruous
directions. My reimaginings generally flip this around, building those things from
scratch while trying to avoid incongruity as much as possible, relying on the
inevitable ineptitude of machine generation to produce those surprising
moments. BC's methods work great for streaming and community, and for
people always seeking new challenges. But I like different things than that,
personally, so here we are.

So far, NaO does these things:
    - Music randomizer
        - imports external music from data files (included)
        - shuffles music appropriately (or inappropriately, if desired)
        - adds four additional battle songs
        - assigns battle and boss music roughly based on difficulty (enemy level)

On the horizon / works currently in progress:
    - Character palette rework
        Should be both more vivid and more consistent/less glitchy than BC.
        Includes skintone randomization from a curated list of possibilities
        Will include repalettings of a few problematic default sprites, if present
        Figaro twins match; The General uses the same palette in or out of chains.
    - Pixelated portrait mode
        If activated, generates portraits based on the top 16x16 of battle "ready" sprite.
        This matches the character's palette.
        Bottom 16x16 used if top 16x16 is empty.
        Possible to replace all portraits or to only replace stock FF6 portraits applied
        to sprites other than their original sprite.
    - Assign battle music tiers based on location
    - Many more song imports to come

Future plans:
    - Save last used modes as default; allow setting a few quick-select mode sets
    - Automatically import Tsushiy instrument patch for better sounding music
    - Incorporate various improvement patches to character abilities
        (rage, dance, swdtech, runic/retort)
    - Full sprite randomization/import as in BC, with more constraints available
    - Script edits to reflect random characters' gender and some other things
    - Could it be that "Rage" is the key to winning this war?
        The Empire is really interested in The Witch for some reason.
        It should reflect an ability she actually has!
    - General de-trolling, changing things that randomly flat-out kill you into
      things that are dangerous, but avoidable without such drastic measures as
      "don't open chests" or "don't cast spells on enemies" or "don't ever use
      my cool nuke ability unless I'm going to die anyway."

Other stuff I'm experimenting with, tentatively:
    - Item rework to be more varied and more casual friendly than BC
        (fewer evade penalties, more variety in types and bonuses)
    - Random spells and effects, if I can make it work
    
    I may also try to port my constraints-based spell palette mod from
    my v63 BC edit, but I never really finished it, and the full random
    spells mode would obsolete it IF I manage to get that off the ground.
